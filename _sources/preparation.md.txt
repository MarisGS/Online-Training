# Pre-workshop Preparation

These things will help you get the most out of this workshop, by
giving you a broad overview at the beginning that you might only get
later on during the workshop.

## Read "How to help someone use a computer" (5 min)

[How to help someone use a computer, by Phil
Agre](https://www.librarian.net/stax/4965/how-to-help-someone-use-a-computer-by-phil-agre/).
Summary: Most of our teaching challenge is helping people to overcome bad user
interface design.


## Browse an ENCCS lesson (5 min)

Please take 5 minutes and go through an [ENCCS
lesson](https://enccs.se/lessons/) and understand the general
layout.  Don't go in-depth to any of the material (unless you want,
obviously). 

You can for example go through one of the following lessons:
- [SYCL](https://enccs.github.io/sycl-workshop/)
- [Julia for HPC](https://enccs.github.io/Julia-for-HPC/)
- [CMake](https://enccs.github.io/cmake-workshop/)
- [Python for HPDA](https://enccs.github.io/HPDA-Python/)
- [Intermediate MPI](https://enccs.github.io/intermediate-mpi/)
- [CUDA](https://enccs.github.io/CUDA/)


## Read "The science of learning" (20 min)

Read this short paper [The Science of
Learning](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/files/papers/science-of-learning-2015.pdf)
which provides a brief overview of some key evidence-based results in
teaching. This paper is also used by [The
Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) for their Instructor Training
workshops.

> ## Remark
>
> Don't worry if there are sections you do not understand. The main objective
> is to have a baseline for our discussions, not to check your ability to teach
> the lesson during the instructor training workshop.
